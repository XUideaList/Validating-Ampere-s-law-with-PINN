# Validating-Ampere-s-law-with-PINN
This project was inspired from one of the experiments in Fundamental Physics Lab course held in Korea Univ 2023 Spring. Here, the ordinary experimental methods of validating ampere's law will be introduced. After that I will refute the logcial pitfall lurking in the original method and suggest a new complementory technique to mitigate it.
