# Validating-Ampere-s-law-with-PINN
Starting from 2023/06/08

This project was inspired from one of the experiments in Fundamental Physics Lab course held in Korea Univ 2023 Spring. Here, the ordinary experimental methods of validating ampere's law will be introduced. After that I will refute the logcial pitfall lurking in the original method and suggest a new complementory technique to mitigate it.

In order to explain the concept of the experiment and challenging it, I have first assumed that the current loop is replaced into two straight wires considering a 2-dimensional configuration. Following the theoretical explanation, I have intoduced my method of merging PINN and the convolution method inspired from CNNs.

As this project is planned to be used in the Undergraduate Physics Research Competition held by KPS in the KPS conference 2024 fall, I will be completing the project within a few weeks and upload additional experimental data that was obtained after the semester was over.
